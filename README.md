# Vanilla Minecraft is boring.
**And that's why you need a mod with new ores, tools, armors, enchants, biomes (soon), chests (soon)!**

### Ores
**Adamantium is very rare and can only be found in deepslate. The durability and the protection of the armor are better than diamond, but not as good as netherite. The full armor give two effects : haste and health boost.**

### Metal detector
**The metal detector is used to easily find ores. There is 90% chance to find it in a Jungle Temple.**

**It can also be found in suspicious sand.**
